## Meet Civic Workbench

Civic Workbench builds tools that make life online safe for humans.

We refuse to the accept status quo of "don't read the comments" and instead see a design problem to solve. Many negative aspects common to online communities are product and plaform failures, not human ones. As technologists we have a responsibility to fix them.

We're just getting started. Based in Chicago, Civic Workbench builds open source tools to mitigate abuse and harassment. Civic Workbench intends to build intervention technologies for online abuse using techniques from product design, investigative journalism and computer science.

Our goal is to ensure that all people can participate fully in online communities.
